# Security and RLS Best Practices

These rules focus on built-in PostgreSQL authorization and row-level controls.

## 1) Enforce least privilege with explicit roles
Use role separation (`read`, `write`, `admin`) and grant only required privileges.

```sql
create role app_readonly nologin;
grant usage on schema public to app_readonly;
grant select on table public.products to app_readonly;
```

## 2) Remove broad default access where possible
Review and tighten default grants (especially `PUBLIC`) for shared schemas.

```sql
revoke all on schema public from public;
```

## 3) Enable RLS for tenant-scoped tables
Apply `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` and policies to make tenant filtering database-enforced.

```sql
alter table orders enable row level security;

create policy orders_tenant_policy on orders
for all
using (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::bigint);
```

## 4) Use `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` when needed
`FORCE` ensures table owners do not bypass policies unintentionally.

```sql
alter table orders force row level security;
```

## 5) Run application traffic as roles subject to RLS
Superusers, roles with `BYPASSRLS`, and table owners can bypass policies unless `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is active. Keep application connections on least-privileged non-owner roles.

## 6) Index columns referenced by policies
RLS predicates run with user queries; index policy columns to avoid full scans.

```sql
create index orders_tenant_id_idx on orders (tenant_id);
```

## 7) Set default privileges for future objects
Use `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` so newly created tables/sequences/functions do not accidentally get overly broad access.

```sql
alter default privileges in schema public
revoke all on tables from public;
```
