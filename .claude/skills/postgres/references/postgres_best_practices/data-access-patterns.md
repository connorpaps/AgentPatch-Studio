# Data Access Pattern Best Practices

These patterns improve throughput and reduce avoidable database work.

## 1) Batch writes instead of row-at-a-time loops
Use multi-row `INSERT` or `COPY` for bulk ingestion.

```sql
insert into events (user_id, action)
values (1, 'click'), (1, 'view'), (2, 'click');
```

## 2) Use `ON CONFLICT` for atomic upserts
Replace check-then-insert/update races with a single SQL statement.

```sql
insert into settings (user_id, key, value)
values (123, 'theme', 'dark')
on conflict (user_id, key)
do update set value = excluded.value;
```

## 3) Prefer keyset pagination for deep paging
`OFFSET` cost grows with page depth; keyset/cursor pagination remains stable. Order by a stable unique key (or compound key with a unique tiebreaker) and build the index in the same column order.

```sql
select * from products
where (created_at, id) > ($1, $2)
order by created_at, id
limit 50;
```

## 4) Avoid N+1 query patterns
Join or batch related lookups rather than issuing one query per row at the application layer.

```sql
select u.id, u.name, o.total
from users u
left join orders o on o.user_id = u.id
where u.active = true;
```

## 5) Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
Parameterized SQL improves safety and can reduce parse/plan overhead for repeated query shapes.

## 6) Use `RETURNING` to avoid extra round trips
When a write needs to return generated IDs or updated values, use `RETURNING` in the same statement.

```sql
insert into orders (customer_id, total)
values ($1, $2)
returning id, created_at;
```

## 7) Keep exploratory reads bounded
Avoid unbounded `SELECT *` in application paths and ad-hoc inspection. Project only the columns needed and use a deterministic `ORDER BY` with a practical `LIMIT`.

```sql
select id, created_at, status
from orders
where created_at >= now() - interval '7 days'
order by created_at desc, id desc
limit 100;
```

## 8) Keep predicates index-friendly
Prefer predicates that let the planner use indexes directly. Avoid wrapping indexed columns in functions unless the same expression is indexed.

```sql
-- Better than date(created_at) = current_date for a plain created_at index:
select id
from events
where created_at >= current_date
  and created_at < current_date + interval '1 day';
```

## 9) Prefer `UNION ALL` and `EXISTS` when semantics allow
Use `UNION ALL` when duplicate removal is not required, and use `EXISTS` for existence checks that do not need row materialization.

```sql
select id from invoices where status = 'open'
union all
select id from invoices where status = 'overdue';

select 1
from orders o
where exists (
  select 1
  from order_items i
  where i.order_id = o.id
);
```

## 10) Shape tables for write-heavy workloads
For high-ingest tables, keep secondary indexes minimal, batch writes, and use `COPY` when loading large files. Consider `UNLOGGED` only for rebuildable staging data where crash recovery and replication tradeoffs are acceptable.

For update-heavy tables, avoid repeatedly updating indexed columns, keep transactions short, and consider table-specific `fillfactor` only after measuring page churn and HOT update behavior.
